Chinese/Locally made C Bot

The bot (nicknamed PolyMath-Coder) essentially assists customers interested in chinese and locally made Nigerian meals in making orders from a list of locally made and chinese items.
The concept is basically centered on the fact that users can readily make orders whenever they so desire and have their orders met all at once.
